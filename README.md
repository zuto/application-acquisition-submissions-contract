# application-acquisition-submissions contract

This repo contains the .net implementation of the contract for calling the Zuto Application Acquisition Submissions api. 

### Data Contract

Zuto Limited has created an api, that allows external organisations to submit applications and partial applications electronically.
To help you integrate with this system we have created this development guide.

Our api is a secure web service, which runs over https.
We use a whitelist, to allow access, so in order to use either the test or production web service, you will need to provide us with the IP addresses of the servers that will require access.

#### Compatibility

This assembly is .NetFramework 4.52 / dotnetcore compatible (dotnetcore 2.0+)

Because we needed to support a .NetFramework 4.52 application, we were unable to build the contract using .NetStandard, but it will work on version 2+ of dotnetcore, and has been tested to this effect.

### Service Endpoint Information

The application endpoint is located at:

- Testing: [https://application-acquisition-submissions.uat.zuto.cloud](https://application-acquisition-submissions.uat.zuto.cloud)
- Production: [https://application-acquisition-submissions.zuto.cloud](https://application-acquisition-submissions.zuto.cloud)

On the service, there are two methods available.

- FullApplication
- PartialApplication

e.g. 

```
https://application-acquisition-submissions.uat.zuto.cloud/fullapplication
https://application-acquisition-submissions.zuto.cloud/partialapplication
```

When sending a request to the endpoint, use a POST, with the content type set to application/json 
e.g.

```
var url = "https://application-acquisition-submissions.uat.zuto.cloud/fullapplication";
var content = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(@contract);
return await new HttpClient().PostAsync(url, new StringContent(content, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json"));
```

or 

```
curl -XPOST -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{}' 'https://application-acquisition-submissions.uat.zuto.cloud/fullapplication'
```

Testing must be carried out against our test api. The initial phase of testing will ensure that your systems can communicate with ours

Once UAT has been successful, we will agree with you a date to switch over to our production web service

### Full Application Contract

The fullapplication method allows you to submit an Application.

_On sending a submission, we assume that the applicant has agreed to our terms and conditions, as published on our website when an application is made, and will be subjected to certain levels of automatic processing that will include credit searching._

For this submission type, an applicant might not be contacted by us until they have been approved by one of the lenders on our panel. 

JSON messages received by this web method are subjected to validation against the schema, published as attributes within the data contract, or as described within this readme. 

- Messages that fail against this schema will return a validation message, along with a status code of BadRequest (400). Failed messages are not processed or stored through our systems.
- Successful messages will return a response code of Created (201) and will be processed through our system.

[^ Back to Top](#application-acquisition-submissions-contract)

#### Example Successful Response:

```
StatusCode: 201
Body:
{
    "AuthToken": "7C3AFF52-9084-4819-B085-22D5B2FE1F8E", 
    "Redirect":"https://www.zuto.com/summary/", 
    "Reference":"123457",
    "ApplicationAccepted": true    
}
```

- AuthToken: can be ignored, this is used by our internal systems to authenticate a user
- Redirect: is a link that can be followed for the user to the next stage. 
    - If the user already has an existing open application, the link will redirect to the sign in page, which will prompt the user to login as an existing user
    - If the user already applied but does not have an existing open application, the link will redirect to the sign in page, which will promt user to login as an existing user
    - If the user is new , a preauthentication link will be returned, which will log the user in, prompt the user to set a password, then redirect to the account area summary page.
- Reference: is the value sent to us, as the SubmittingPartyReference value
- ApplicationAccepted: is an internal field, which describes whether we have accepted the application or not.

[^ Back to Top](#application-acquisition-submissions-contract)

#### Example Validation Failure Response:

```
StatusCode: 400
Body:
{"Message":"SubmittingParty element is missing"}
```

- *Message*: will be returned, with the reason that the message was rejected.

[^ Back to Top](#application-acquisition-submissions-contract)

#### Example System Failure Response

```
StatusCode: 500
{"Message":"A server exception has occured."}
```

This will only occur, if our system is experiencing some kind of fault, or the contract you supplied does not follow the same format as described in this document. A test example is provided to help diagnose this issue.

# Populating the FullApplication contract
